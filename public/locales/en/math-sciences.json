        "content": "Mean is the sum of all data values divided by the number of data points. Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data value and the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, representing how far data values are from the mean. Mode is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. First quartile is the maximum value of the lower 25% of the data when arranged in ascending order. Median is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending order. Third quartile is the minimum value of the upper 25% of the data when arranged in ascending order. Covariance indicates the tendency of two variables to vary together. Correlation coefficient measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables."

        "content": "Regression analysis is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between variables. It helps in understanding the relationship between variables and predicting future outcomes. Linear regression is the most basic form of this analysis, finding the best-fitting line for the data. The equation of the line is expressed as Y = b0 + b1X + Îµ. This section describes the mathematical model, types, applications, and importance of regression analysis."
